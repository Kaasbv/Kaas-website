        <p>The most important ingredient of cheese is of course milk. The origin and type of milk are also a great factor
          for the taste. This is why our milk is coming from dutch cows on the dutch grasslands<br><br>The cows get high
          quality food, enough space and ofcourse lots of love. They'll be outside atleast 8 hours a day and can choose
          when the want to be milked with our automatic milk machines. After milking it is saved in barrels.<br></p>

        <p>Now the most difficult part, actually creating the cheese. It is created in the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Acidification: the first step of making cheese is adding a starter culture. These are bacteria who turn
            the sugar in the milk into lactic acid.</li>
          <li>Coalugation: if the ph of the milk is low enough after the first step, the coalugant can be added to
            solify the milk.</li>
          <li>Cutting and seperating: it will now form curds and whey, the curds are cut in pieces and the whey is
            seperated. </li>
          <li>Aging: it will be stored for as long the specific taste requires.</li>
        </ol>
        When a cheese is ready to be sold it well be packaged and added to our sellable inventory and show up on the
        site.

        <p>When an order comes in the different cheeses will be collected by our warehouse employees and packaged securely. After that the
          package is given to UPS to be sent to America. And after a week it will be on your doormat.</p>
