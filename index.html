          <img src= "images/logo.png" alt="Cheese" height= "300px" width="300px"> </img>
          <p>The Beiler Caseus is a very enthousiastic company looking to introduce dutch top quality dutch cheese to the American People.</p>
        </div>
        <p>When we scope in on the cheese market in the United States, we see that there is barely anyone taking advantage in this market. The average American eats a lot of cheese, but this consists mostly out of "fake" products. for example cheddar cheese, cheese balls and cheese spray.</p>  
        <p>The Beiler Caseus wants to bring some change by introducing "luxury cheese" on the American Market. The American people Adore their "influencers" and by introducing a high end product on the market we want to change the social image of cheese.</p>
        <p>The cheese from the Beiler Caseus is going to be made and produced in the Beilevaard, which is located in Drenthe, the Netherlands. After the production Process it will be shipped by UPS to America in Special pre-ripening containers.</p>
