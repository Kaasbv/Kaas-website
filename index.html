          <p>The most important ingredient of cheese is of course milk. The origin and type of milk are also a great factor
            for the taste. This is why our milk is coming from dutch cows on the dutch grasslands<br><br>The cows get high
            quality food, enough space and ofcourse lots of love. They'll be outside atleast 8 hours a day and can choose
            when they want to be milked with our automatic milk machines. After milking it is saved in barrels.<br></p>

          <p>Now the most difficult part, actually creating the cheese. It is created in the following steps:
          <ol>
            <li>Acidification: the first step of making cheese is adding a starter culture. These are bacteria who turn
              the sugar in the milk into lactic acid.</li>
            <li>Coagulation: if the ph of the milk is low enough after the first step, the coalugant can be added to
              solify the milk.</li>
            <li>Cutting and seperating: it will now form curds and whey, the curds are cut in pieces and the whey is
              seperated. </li>
            <li>Aging: The cheese will be put to rest from a few weeks to a few months depending on how long that kind of cheese needs to mature.</li>
          </ol>
          When a cheese is ready to be sold it well be packaged, added to our sellable inventory and show up on the
          site.

        <p>The Beiler Caseus is a very enthousiastic company looking to introduce dutch top quality dutch cheese to the American People.</p>
        <p>When we scope in on the cheese market in the United States, we see that there is barely anyone taking advantage in this market. The average American eats a lot of cheese, but this consists mostly out of "fake" products. for example cheddar cheese, cheese balls and cheese spray.</p>  
        <p>The Beiler Caseus wants to bring some change by introducing "luxury cheese" on the American Market. The American people Adore their "influencers" and by introducing a high end product on the market we want to change the social image of cheese.</p>
        <p>The cheese from the Beiler Caseus is going to be made and produced in the Beilevaard, which is located in Drenthe, the Netherlands. After the production Process it will be shipped by UPS to America in Special pre-ripening containers.</p>
